The SFSI Package implements shrinkage and variable selection regression procedures into the Selection Index framework. In this repository we maintain the latest (developing) version. This version contains the full data used in [Lopez-Cruz *et al.* (2020)](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-020-65011-2) (not provided through the CRAN version) for the development of penalized selection indices.

## Package installation

Installation of SFSI package requires a R-version greater than 3.5.0

From CRAN (stable version)
```r
install.packages('SFSI',repos='https://cran.r-project.org/')
```

From GitHub (developing version)
```r
  install.packages('remotes',repos='https://cran.r-project.org/')  # 1. install remotes
  library(remotes)                                                 # 2. load the library
  install_github('MarcooLopez/SFSI')                               # 3. install SFSI from GitHub
```

## Selection Indices (SI)

Prediction of **breeding values** (u<sub><i>i</i></sub>) for a target trait (y<sub><i>i</i></sub>) is usually done using a **Selection Index (SI)**.
In the selection index all the available information contribute to the prediction of the *i*<sup>th</sup> candidate of selection as a linear combination of the form:

<p align="center">

</p>

or (in matrix notation)

<p align="center">
<img src="https://github.com/MarcooLopez/SFSI/blob/master/vignettes/Img2.png" height="27"/>
</p>

where the predictors <b>x</b><sub><i>i</i></sub> can be indirect information from either:

- Correlated traits measured in the same candidates
- Measurements on the same trait of interest collected on related individuals

In the first case, the borrowing of information is provided by the **genetic covariance between the target trait and measured traits**. The second case is a kinship-based prediction approach since the borrowing of information is taken from **genetic relateness among individuals**. These relationships can be provided through either a pedigree- or marker-based relationship matrix (**genomic prediction**).

### Standard Selection Index

The weights <b>&beta;</b><sub><i>i</i></sub> = (&beta;<sub><i>i1</i></sub>,...,&beta;<sub><i>ip</i></sub>)'
are derived by minimizing the optimization problem:

<p align="center">
<img src="https://github.com/MarcooLopez/SFSI/blob/master/vignettes/Img3.png" height="40"/>
</p>

Under standard assumptions, the solution to the above problem is

<p align="center">
<img src="https://github.com/MarcooLopez/SFSI/blob/master/vignettes/Img4.png" height="28"/>
</p>

where <b>P</b><sub>x</sub> is the phenotypic variance-covariance matrix among predictors, <b>x</b><sub><i>i</i></sub>, and <b>G</b><sub>xy</sub> is a vector with the genetic covariances between predictors <b>x</b><sub><i>i</i></sub> and response y<sub><i>i</i></sub>.

### Penalized Selection Index
The regression coefficients can be derived by impossing a penalization in the above optimization function as

<p align="center">
<img src="https://github.com/MarcooLopez/SFSI/blob/master/vignettes/Img5.png" height="32"/>
</p>

where &lambda; is a penalty parameter and <i>F</i>(<b>&beta;</b><sub><i>i</i></sub>)
is a penalty function on the regression coefficients. A value of &lambda;=0 yields the coefficients for the standard (un-penalized) selection index. Commonly used penalty functions are based on the L1- and L2- norms.

* **L1-penalized Selection Index.** Is obtained using the L1-norm:

<p align="center">
<img src="https://github.com/MarcooLopez/SFSI/blob/master/vignettes/Img6.png" height="28"/>
</p>

This problem does not have a closed form solution; however, a solution can be obtained using iterative algorithms such as Least Angle Regression (LARS) (Efron, 2004) or Coordinate Descent algorithms (Friedman, 2007). These algorithms are implemented in the SFSI R-package using <b>P</b><sub>x</sub> and <b>G</b><sub>xy</sub> as inputs.

* **L2-penalized Selection Index.** Is obtained using the L2-norm:

<p align="center">
<img src="https://github.com/MarcooLopez/SFSI/blob/master/vignettes/Img7.png" height="30"/>
</p>

In this case, the solution has the following closed form:

<p align="center">
<img src="https://github.com/MarcooLopez/SFSI/blob/master/vignettes/Img8.png" height="27"/>
</p>

where <b>I</b> is an identity matrix.

* **Elastic-Net-penalized SI.** An elastic-net penalized index considers a penalization being a weighted sum of both norms,

<p align="center">
<img src="https://github.com/MarcooLopez/SFSI/blob/master/vignettes/Img9.png" height="30"/>
</p>

where &alpha; is a weighting parameter.

The L1-penalized and L2-penalized SI appear as special cases of the Elastic-Net-penalized index when &alpha;=1 and &alpha;=0, respectively.

**NOTE:** As for the L1-penalized SI, if &alpha;>0, no closed form solution exists. Solutions can be obtained using only the Coordinate Descent algorithm (Friedman, 2007). This method is implemented in the SFSI R-package using <b>P</b><sub>x</sub>, <b>G</b><sub>xy</sub> and &alpha; as inputs.

### Sparse Selection Index.
A Penalized Selection Index involving the L1-norm is refered to as **Sparse Selection Index** as the norm induces variable selection (sparsity in the coefficients).
